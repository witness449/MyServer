MyServer is the server part of a two-component application.

This application is being developed as part of a graduation project. The goal of this work is to develop a messenger that implements a Matrix-like protocol for interaction between the client and server parts.
Certain sections of the code are based on the QtWebApp HTTP server library.

Development is carried out in C++ using the Qt framework.
